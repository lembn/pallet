Clicking one of these opens up a note pad of that note. The note squares have the note title and the first few lines of the note's content. On hover a red trash can delete button fades in on the bottom right.

When in notepad mode, the creator of a note can choose to set it to edtiable, allowing viewers to edit the note. There will be an [animation](https://youtu.be/qJt-FtzJ5fo) between the notes page and the notepad editing page.

There will be a search bar at the bottom where users can search for network addresses of other user's notes.

The application will be built using Electron for NodeJS (using ReactJS).

The network connections will be peer to peer
