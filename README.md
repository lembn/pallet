# pallet

> Pallet allows users to share local files over a network connection.

## TODO

- addresses are made of `[ip]:[node_id]`
  - each user has a client socket which does the scanning and sends download requests
  - each user also has a server socket which processes download requests

## ROADMAP

- In-application file editor to allow collaboration
- Create arbitrary notes instead of creating files and uploading them
